This section contains a list of tools for project management used by FSU Libraries. In each section, we outline how we use each tool and some benefits and drawbacks.

### 1. Trello

**Uses and Overview**

[Trello](https://trello.com) is an application for tracking tasks. It allows you to move individual cards (representing tasks) as they enter different phases. Trello allows you to assign tasks to different collaborators, create due dates, and provide contextual information for the tasks to be completed.

FSU Libraries' Office of Digital Research and Scholarship uses Trello to manage its tasks. There is a "General" board that manages all of the top-level projects that DRS is working on. For example, each card will represent a larger initiative or project that the office is working on. This board represents the "big-picture" for the office. There are also boards for individual projects, which track the small tasks that need to be completed. So, for example the *Il secolo* project has its own board, which has cards for small website updates, digitization needs, and communication tasks.

The Data Management Team has also been experimenting with Trello for tracking consultations. They use a template card that contains all of the information needed for creating new Data Management Plans (name of PI, grant applied for, due date, etc). They also use some standard checklists in the template card. This card can easily be copied so that the Data Management Team could consistently capture the same data and perform the same tasks for every consultation. It also gives them an easy method for tracking who to follow up with. 

**Benefits:**

* very similar to analog/paper SCRUM boards
* feature-specific prioritization
* bug tracking
* useful for tracking action/discussion items from meetings
* able to link or attach supporting documents to cards

**Drawbacks**

* showing hierarchy of tasks not really possible
* not able to easily produce a to-do list (i.e. from the user's end, a list of tasks that the user is assigned to)

### 2. Google Apps

**Uses and Overview**

[Google Apps](http://drive.google.com) (specifically, Google Drive) is a suit of tools for creating documents collaboratively and sharing information. Google Apps include a text, spreadsheet, and slide editor, as well as applications for drawing, organizing calendars, and sharing (but not editing) other types of files.

FSU Libraries uses Google Docs for drafting project documentation, sharing meeting agendas, and collaboratively editing meeting notes. Since many authors can edit documents at the same time, it is a great tool for real time collaboration. However, since it does allow for so much editing, we preserve static forms of documentation using SharePoint.

**Benefits:**

* easy to share documents with large teams for collaboration
* easily searchable and organizable

**Drawbacks**

* you may need to use another tool to track/organize relevant documents, especially if there are a lot of them

### 3. SharePoint

**Uses and Overview**

FSU Libraries uses Sharepoint to organize its internal documentation. Sharepoint allows you to organize teams into different sites, all of which can have team discussions, shared documents, updates, resources, etc. Each team at FSU has a site (which functions like a wiki) where team members post updates about different projects, hold static versions of documentation, and share updates. Sharepoint also allows you to create different permissions for different sites and pages. So, for example, some pages could be view-only for certain members, or not viewable at all. This allows you to be open about projects, but also keep certain documents private.

**Benefits**

* allows users to combine document organization with web-pages
* wiki-like organization of resources
* permissions management

**Drawbacks**

* can be very fragile (editing has quirks, especially if you leave pages in edit mode for too long)
* WYSIWYG editor is not intuitive

### 4. Slack

**Uses and Overview**

[Slack](https://slack.com) is a communication app for teams. It integrates with several of the project management tools on this list, and allows team members to communicate more easily and informally than through email.

**Benefits:**

* allows for easy communication between entire organizations, small groups within the organization, and individual members
* integrates with many other applications (e.g. Google Docs, Trello, GitHub, etc.)
* allows members to easily set up reminders, take notes-to-self

**Drawbacks**

* free version only has a 10,000 message capacity (older messages get deleted)

<h2 id="section2">Project Proposals - Defining your Project</h2>

**This section still needs to be edited**

The goal of a project proposal is to document agreement between all parties (sponsor, stakeholder, staff) about the goals, scope, and deliverables of the project. Ideally, the document defines time, scope and cost.

It is useful to use this time to answer questions about cost/benefit and the extent to which people can actually reasonably contribute to the project. The Project Management Group recommends discussing the following questions at this stage:

* Why?
  * What are the objectives of the project?
  * What are the expected benefits of the project?
* Scope?
  * What is the scope of the project? (specifically, what's not in scope...)
  * How will we know the the project is done?
* Who are the stakeholders?
  * Who is the end user audience?
  * Who is going to work on the project?
  * Who is managing the project?
  * Who is/are the sponsors of the project?
* How much time can participants reasonably spend on the project

After the answers to these questions have been decided upon, the Project Charter itself should be drafted. The following is the basic format of a Project Charter:
1. Project name
2. Description (high-level statement of your project goal)
3. Success criteria (how will we know when the project is done?)  â€“ SMART goals
4. Requirements (deliverables, optionals, & out of scope) 
5. Project team (including roles) 
6. Milestones/Schedule (high-level + proposed dates) 

Drafting the charter is an iterative process:
* Write a draft
* Share it with project team
* Share it with stakeholders
* Rewrite
* Repeat until consensus
